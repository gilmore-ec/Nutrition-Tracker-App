## Project Overview

### Description

This app is a privacy-focused nutrition tracking application designed to simplify the process of meticulously tracking nutrition and health metrics. Many applications exist that have provide a run-of-the-mill nutrition tracker, but I have yet to find an application that provides truly accurate tracking solutions while ensuring user privacy. This app solves that problem by utilizing zero-knowledge encryption and state-of-the-art enterprise data security standards for **ALL** user-provided data.

### Functionality

**Q: What can I do with this app?**
**A:** There are several impactful features:
1. You can enter meal nutrition after measuring ingredients, while the app automatically computes the nutritional value of the meal.
2. You can enter a new ingredient's nutrition label either manually, or using an OCR camera tool to scan the label for you!
3. You can enter your weight, body composition, or whether you hit the gym (along with some insights into your workout if you want :) )
    - Later features will include automatic integration with your smartwatch and retrieving health information from other apps for secure encryption.
4. You can review your trends in calorie and nutrition intake, as well as your weight and body composition over time and export the reports.
5. You can audit your data on your device or online to ensure that you didn't miss out on entering last night's midnight snack.

**Q:** Wait a minute, you said the app was privacy focused, but it will interact with other apps and my data is available online?!
**A:** Yes! Using state-of-the-art encryption standards from the moment your data is first entered, the app ensures that no other apps or even our own servers are able to decrypt your data! The only way to see that data is to have access to the account that created it. So once you create your account, make sure to use a secure password and never share it with anyone who you don't trust with your health data.
