## Tasks

### MainActivity

- [ ] Displays options for entering new data, and confirming data when a day's tracking has been completed.
- [ ] Displays trend tracking for the current week and identify monthly/annual trends.
- [ ] Handles on-device data storage and usage.
- [ ] Handles user authentication.

### UX

- [ ] Daily data should be entered in separate sessions which all show the history of data entered on that same day (to avoid repeated entries).
- [ ] Completing a day's entries should not be confirmed on the same page as the session's submission form.

### Technical

- [ ] Refactor supporting java files (e.g. NutritionLabel.java, Macro.java, etc.) to a separate package for reusability and maintainability.
- [ ] Use secure encryption for all personal, health, and identifying data.
